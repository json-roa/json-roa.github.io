      <h1 id="json-roa">JSON-ROA</h1>
      
      <p>JSON-ROA - a JSON extension for resource and relation oriented architectures providing explorable APIs for humans and machines.</p>
      
      <p>The JSON-ROA specification is not yet finished and thus 
      <em>BETA</em>.</p>
      
      <h2 id="objectives-and-properties">Objectives and Properties</h2>
      
      <h3 id="for-restful-http">For RESTful HTTP</h3>
      
      <p>JSON-ROA is well suited for API build with REST in mind.</p>
      
      <h3 id="unobtrusive">Unobtrusive</h3>
      
      <p>JSON-ROA is designed to interfere as minimal as possible with the JSON
      structure. Support for existing RESTful APIs can added easily without
      breaking existing clients. </p>
      
      <h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
      
      <p>JSON-ROA does a few things very well, at least much better than the existing
      proposals we found elsewhere. It favors simplicity over excessive flexibility.
      You might want to take a look at <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> (which is
      actually pretty good) if you are looking for something alike. However, such
      flexibility comes with the price of complexity. </p>
      
      <h3 id="for-humans">For Humans</h3>
      
      <p>We believe that there is value in providing tools such that humans can
      understand a API quickly and naturally. JSON-ROA features <a href="/browser/index.html">The JSON-ROA
      Browser</a> to explore APIs. </p>
      
      <h3 id="for-programmers">For Programmers</h3>
      
      <p>JSON-ROA is designed such that clients can be programmed with little
      effort and minimal risk of getting it wrong. </p>
      
      <h2 id="differentiation">Differentiation</h2>
      
      <p>Constraints can be liberating. JSON-ROA does not support or discourages
      some practices deliberately. If you planing on doing much of the likes
      below we recommend to look somewhere else. </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>JSON-ROA does not support RPC style usage of HTTP very well.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If your API is not resource oriented you might find yourself
      fighting JSON-ROA.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
